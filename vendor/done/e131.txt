Going Back in Rails 5

In this article, we will see the changes required to get the original railscasts Going Back to work on Rails 5. Create the models.
 
```
rails g model product name category:references price:decimal description:text
rails g model category name
rails g model cart token
rails g model cart_item product:references cart:references quantity:integer
```

Change the migration for `create_cart_times`:

```ruby
t.integer :quantity, default: 1 
```

Since we make the quantity default to one, we can delete the following private method:

```ruby
private

def default_quantity_to_one
  self.quantity ||= 1
end
```

in `cart_item` model. Generate the controllers.

```
rails g controller cart_items create
rails g controller carts show
rails g controller categories
rails g controller products
```
