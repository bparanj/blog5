Helpers Outside Views in Rails 5
-

In this article, we will the changes required to get the original railscast on using helpers outside views working in Rails 5. Here is the create action in products controller:

```ruby
  def create
    @product = Product.new(allowed_params)
    if @product.save
      flash[:notice] = "Successfully created product #{view_context.link_to('product', @product)}."
      redirect_to @product
    else
      render :new
    end
  end
```

Use `html_safe` in the application.html.erb.

```rhtml
<%- flash.each do |name, msg| -%>
  <%= content_tag :div, msg.html_safe, :id => "flash_#{name}" %>
<%- end -%>
```

You will now see the linke to the product in the flash message. You can download the source code from `https://github.com/bparanj/sto.re`.
