ActiveModelSerializer Basics in Rails 5

Create a new Rails API only app.

```
rails new rapi --api
```

If you list middelware.

```
rake middleware
```

You will see:

```
use Rack::Sendfile
use ActionDispatch::Static
use ActionDispatch::Executor
use ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache::Middleware
use Rack::Runtime
use ActionDispatch::RequestId
use Rails::Rack::Logger
use ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions
use ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions
use ActionDispatch::RemoteIp
use ActionDispatch::Reloader
use ActionDispatch::Callbacks
use ActiveRecord::Migration::CheckPending
use Rack::Head
use Rack::ConditionalGet
use Rack::ETag
use ActionView::Digestor::PerRequestDigestCacheExpiry
run Rapi::Application.routes
```

The API does not have the middelware that is included in Rails web app such as:

```
use Rack::MethodOverride
use WebConsole::Middleware
use ActionDispatch::Cookies
use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore
use ActionDispatch::Flash
```

In application_controller.rb:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
end
```

Create an article scaffold.

```
rails g scaffold article title content 
```

Add active_model_serializers gem to Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'active_model_serializers'
```

and run bundle. Create a serializer for article model.

``` 
rails g serializer article
```

By default the generator only includes the id field. We can add other fields in the ArticleSerializer.

```ruby
class ArticleSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :id, :title, :content
end
```

Run the migration.

```
rails db:migrate
```

Add sample data in seeds.rb:

``` 
Article.create! title: "Superman", content: "Superman is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in publications by DC Comics, widely considered to be an American cultural icon. Created by American writer Jerry Siegel and Canadian-born American artist Joe Shuster in 1932 while both were living in Cleveland, Ohio, and sold to Detective Comics, Inc."
 Article.create! title: "Krypton", content: "Krypton is a fictional planet in the DC Comics universe, and the native world of the super-heroes Superman and, in some tellings, Supergirl and Krypto the Superdog."
 Article.create! title: "Batman & Robin", content: "Batman is a fictional character created by the artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. A comic book superhero, Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics.)"
```

Seed the database.

```
rails db:seed
```

Start the server.

``` 
rails s
```

Hit the articles index endpoint using curl.

``` 
curl http://localhost:3000/articles
```

You will see the json output.

```json  
 [{"id":1,"title":"Superman","content":"Superman is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in publications by DC Comics, widely considered to be an American cultural icon. Created by American writer Jerry Siegel and Canadian-born American artist Joe Shuster in 1932 while both were living in Cleveland, Ohio, and sold to Detective Comics, Inc. (later DC Comics) in 1938, the character first appeared in Action Comics #1 (June 1938) and subsequently appeared in various radio serials, television programs, films, newspaper strips, and video games."},{"id":2,"title":"Krypton","content":"Krypton is a fictional planet in the DC Comics universe, and the native world of the super-heroes Superman and, in some tellings, Supergirl and Krypto the Superdog. Krypton has been portrayed consistently as having been destroyed just after Superman's flight from the planet, with exact details of its destruction varying by time period, writers and franchise. Kryptonians were the dominant people of Krypton"},{"id":3,"title":"Batman \u0026 Robin","content":"Batman is a fictional character created by the artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. A comic book superhero, Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics. Originally referred to as The Bat-Man and still referred to at times as The Batman."}]
```

The generated scaffold has index action that renders the list of all articles in json format.

``` 
def index
  @articles = Article.all

  render json: @articles
end
```

## Summary

In this article, we built a simple Rails 5 JSON API only app using active_model_serializers gem.
