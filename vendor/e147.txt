Sortable Lists in Rails 5

Add:

```
//= require jquery-ui
```

to application.js.

content_tag_for was available in Rails 3 and 4. It has been removed from Rails 5.

```ruby
gem 'record_tag_helper', '~> 1.0'
```

bundle


```
couldn't find file 'jquery-ui' with type 'application/javascript'
```

```ruby
gem 'jquery-ui-rails'
```

bundle


No luck with `jquery-turbolinks` gem to workaround turbolinks conflict with drag and drop functionality. Remove turbolinks gem. Remove the turbolins related code in application layout. Remove the turbo links require statement in application.js.
