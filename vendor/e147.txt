Sortable Lists in Rails 5

In this article, you will learn how to get the railscast episode 147 on sortable lists to work with Rails 5.

Add:

```
//= require jquery-ui
```

to application.js.

The `content_tag_for` was available in Rails 3 and 4. It has been removed from Rails 5. You can install `record_tag_helper` to use that tag in Rails 5.

```ruby
gem 'record_tag_helper', '~> 1.0'
```

Run bundle. Reload the faq page. You will get the error:

```
couldn't find file 'jquery-ui' with type 'application/javascript'
```

Add jquery-ui-rails gem to the Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'jquery-ui-rails'
```

Run bundle. This still will not work. I installed `jquery-turbolinks` gem to workaround turbolinks conflict with drag and drop functionality. 

- Remove turbolinks gem. 
- Remove the turbolins related code in application layout. 
- Remove the turbo links require statement in application.js.

Now the drag and drop will work. You can download the code from [Sortable Lists in Rails 5 without Turbolinks](https://github.com/bparanj/faq.app 'Sortable Lists in Rails 5'). You don't need acts_as_list gem to fix the problem where a new faq has null value for the position. When a new faq is created, add a `after_create` action that populates the position attribute to the existing highest value + 1.
