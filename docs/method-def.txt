How to Find Out Where a Method is Defined in Rails 5

## View Helpers

What are the available view helpers?

```
 > helper.methods
 => [:title, :admin_area, :alert, :cookies, :view_cache_dependencies, :protect_against_forgery?, :form_authenticity_token, :notice, :fragment_cache_key, :config, :config=, :locale, :locale=, :logger, :default_formats, :default_formats=, :logger=, :streaming_completion_on_exception, ...] 
```

The result shows that we have Rails 5 specific helpers as well as the helpers that we defined in our project such as title, `admin_area` etc.

Where are the view helper methods such as `truncate`, `link_to` and `number_to_currency` defined in Rails 5? We can use the `method` method to answer that question.

```
 > helper.method(:truncate)
 => #<Method: ActionView::Base(ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper)#truncate> 
 > helper.method(:link_to)
 => #<Method: ActionView::Base(ActionView::Helpers::UrlHelper)#link_to> 
 > helper.method(:number_to_currency)
 => #<Method: ActionView::Base(ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper)#number_to_currency> 
```

## Class Methods

How to find out where a class method in our application is defined? We can use the `singleton_method` that takes the name of the class method as the argument in combination with `source_location` method.

```
 > Task.singleton_method(:incomplete).source_location
 => ["/Users/bparanj/projects/blog5/app/models/task.rb", 9] 
```

This technique will work even for code that you did not write such as gems that application uses.

## Controller Helpers

What helpers are available in our controllers?

``` 
 > ApplicationController.helpers.methods
 => [:title, :admin_area, :alert, :cookies, :view_cache_dependencies, :protect_against_forgery?, :form_authenticity_token, :notice, :fragment_cache_key, :config, :config=, :locale, :locale=, :logger, :default_formats, :default_formats=, :logger=, :streaming_completion_on_exception, :debug_missing_translation, :debug_missing_translation=, :assets_manifest, :assets_prefix, :assets_prefix=, :digest_assets, ...] 
```
