Integrating Google reCAPTCHA with Rails 5 App

-

Why not Akismet? The pricing is not reasonable. If it had Amazon like low pay as you go pricing based on usage, I might consider it. We will only be looking at client side integration. You can refer the documentation for server side integration.

-

[Register](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list 'Register') your site. You will get site key and secret key. Site key looks like this:

```
6LchqxwTAAAAAOLMBU4fPhAoLQJ3Y9DaX0qkC8st
```

This can be viewed in the html. The secret key is used for server side integration and it must be kept secret.

-

For, client side integration, paste this snippet before the closing `</head>` tag on your HTML template:

```html
<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
```

Add `yield :recaptcha` to application layout file. Add `content_for :recaptcha` in feedback page.

-

Paste this snippet at the end of the `<form>` where you want the reCAPTCHA widget to appear:

```html
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6LchqxwTAAAAAOLMBU4fPhAoLQJ3Y9DaX0qkC8st"></div>
```

In our case, we will add it to the feedback form.

-

You can also add this to your user registration page. You can also prevent automated scripts from downloading any files repeatedly. This will prevent wasting money on Amazon S3.
