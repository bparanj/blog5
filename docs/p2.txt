[Active Record gets a few extra query methods](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24315 'Active Record query methods')

Ever find yourself writing cumbersome things like User.count.zero?? You can now use the terser User.none?, as well as User.one? and User.empty?, as these three methods just got added.

[The default worker pool size for Action Cable just got lowered considerably!](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24376 'Worker Pool Size')

The author of this revision put it best: "Whack it down from 100 to 4". This will decrease the number of db connections for most, who probably don't need so many.

Prepared statements to have a cache separate from unprepared statements by Sean Griffin
https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3af40b71f34c70a274e261cd6e6468c613de648e


This subtle bug was fixed this week, wherein a connection that was established with prepared statements enabled could fail if a query that had been previously run was run again with prepared statements disabled. This was because it was hitting the same cache as the prepared statements-enabled query. Prepared statements now have their own cache, which solves the problem. Hurrah!

rails runner now shows the correct command name when run with Spring by Yuuji Yaginuma
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24325

Running rails runner with no arguments or with the --help flag shows you some information on how to use the runner as a shebang line. Unfortunately, if you were using Spring, it would get the path wrong because Spring changes a variable that relates to the command that was run (bin/rails). That just got fixed in this revision!

Using rails restart with Puma now works! by Prathamesh Sonpatki
https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/24331

Previously, when issuing rails restart with Puma running, it would fail to bring it up again since Puma was trying to inspect ARGV to decide how to go about it. The fix involved changing Puma to allow its configuration options to be overridden by Rails. Great job!
