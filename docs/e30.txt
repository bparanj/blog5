Pretty Page Title

The title does not change when you view different pages on the site.

In application layout file.

<title> MyComm Site - <%= content_for?(:title) ? yield(:title) : 'The Biggest Online Store on Earth' %> </title>


In `products/new.html.erb`:

<% title "New Product" %>

-

module ApplicationHelper
  def title(page_title)
    content_for(:title) { page_title }
  end
end

-

The view that does not call the title helper will now have the default title.
