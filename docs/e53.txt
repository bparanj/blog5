Browsing to an non-existing task `http://localhost:3000/tasks/100` throws a stack trace when ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound exception is raised. This is the behavior in development environment.

-

In development.rb, you can see:

```
# Show full error reports.
config.consider_all_requests_local = true
```

This flag is the reason why the stack trace is shown in the browser.

-

RAILS_ENV=production rails s

Hit the URL with task id that does not exist in the database: `http://localhost:3001/tasks/100`

In the browser:

```
An unhandled lowlevel error occurred. The application logs may have details.
```

In the log file:

```
Rack app error: #<RuntimeError: Missing `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set this value in `config/secrets.yml`>
```

-

export SECRET_KEY_BASE='secret'

In the browser:

```
We're sorry, but something went wrong.
If you are the application owner check the logs for more information.
```

-

We can render 404 by customizing the exception handling.

rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :not_found_error

protected

def not_found_error
  render plain: '404 Not Found', status: :not_found
end

-

500.html is displayed in production.

-

Displays '404 Not Found' in development.


-

render file: 'public/401', status: :not_found
	
Does not work in dev.

-

render nothing: true, status: :unauthorized

does not work.

-

consider_all_requests_local = true

means the stack trace will be displayed on the browser
