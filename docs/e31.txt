Customizing Time Format in Rails 5 Apps

-

In `products/index.html.erb`:

```ruby
<%= task.due_date %>
```

Gives ugly output.

```
task.name due on 2016-01-17
task.name due on 2016-01-17
task.name due on 2016-01-17
```

The `due_date.to_s(:long)` output.

```
task.name due on January 17, 2016
task.name due on January 17, 2016
task.name due on January 17, 2016
```

The output for `:short` format.

```
task.name due on 17 Jan
task.name due on 17 Jan
task.name due on 17 Jan
```

The output for `:db` format.

```
task.name due on 2016-01-17
task.name due on 2016-01-17
task.name due on 2016-01-17
```

We can customize the time format like this:

due_date.strftime("due on %B %d at %I:%M %p")

This will lead to duplication if we need to call from different views. Let's see how we can define our own time format that will allow us to do `due_date.to_s(:due_time)`

-

Create `config/initializers/custom_time_formats.rb` file with time format customization:

```
Time::DATE_FORMATS[:due_time] = "due at %B %d on %I:%M %p"
```

-

Restart server and reload tasks index page.

In order to display the date as well as the time, we need to use datetime column not date. Modify the migration for adding the `due_date`.

```ruby
class AddDueDateToTasks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_column :tasks, :due_date, :datetime
  end
end
```

Let's populate the database with new data that has values for `due_date` column in tasks table.

```
rails db:drop
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

The `tasks/index.html.erb`:

```ruby
<tbody>
  <% @task_months.each do |month, tasks| %>
    <%= month.strftime('%B') %>
  <tr>
    <% for task in tasks %>
  	<div class='task'>
  		<strong>  <%= task.name %> </strong>
  		<%= task.due_date.to_s(:due_time) %>
  	</div>
    <% end %>
   </tr>		 
  <% end %>	  
</tbody>
```

Reload the tasks index page:

```
task.name due on January 17 at 11:23 PM
task.name due on January 17 at 11:23 PM
task.name due on January 17 at 11:23 PM
```
