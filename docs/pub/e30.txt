Pretty Page Title

Problem : The title does not change when you view different pages on the site.

## Steps

### Step 1

In application layout file add this.

```rhtml
<title> MyComm Site - <%= content_for?(:title) ? yield(:title) : 'The Biggest Online Store on Earth' %> </title>
```

### Step 2

In `products/new.html.erb` use the title view helper to display the title:

```rhtml
<% title "New Product" %>
```

### Step 3

```ruby
module ApplicationHelper
  def title(page_title)
    content_for(:title) { page_title }
  end
end
```

The view that does not call the title helper will now have the default title.

## Summary

In this article, you learned how to use custom view helper to customize the title an any page of your Rails 5 web app.
