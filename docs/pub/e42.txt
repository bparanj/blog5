 Without <tt>with_options</tt>, this code contains duplication:

   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
     has_many :customers, dependent: :destroy
     has_many :products,  dependent: :destroy
     has_many :invoices,  dependent: :destroy
     has_many :expenses,  dependent: :destroy
   end

 Using <tt>with_options</tt>, we can remove the duplication:

   class Account < ActiveRecord::Base
     with_options dependent: :destroy do |assoc|
       assoc.has_many :customers
       assoc.has_many :products
       assoc.has_many :invoices
       assoc.has_many :expenses
     end
   end
