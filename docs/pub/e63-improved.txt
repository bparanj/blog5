Model Name in URL

## Steps
### Step 1

Override `to_param` in product model. In product model.

```ruby
def to_param
  "#{id}-#{permalink}"
end

private

def permalink
  name.gsub(/[^a-z1-9]+/i, '-')
end
```

### Step 2

In seeds.rb.

```ruby
p = Product.new(name: 'rug', price: 100)
Product.create(name: 'big bowl', price: 20.95)
Product.create(name: 'pillow', price: 90)
Product.create(name: 'light', price: 10.95)

c = Category.create(name: 'Clothes')
Category.create(name: 'Furniture')
Category.create(name: 'Groceries')
Category.create(name: 'Electronics')

p.categories << c
p.save!
```

Run rake db:seed.

### Step 3

Browse to `http://localhost:3000/products` and click on show for any product. You will now see product name in the URL.

> Note that you DON'T want to use "_" as the separator between the id and the permalink, if you rely on String#to_i. If you use "_" and the permalink part begins with a number, you could get e.g. "123_456blah", and "123_456blah".to_i is 123456, not the expected 123. This is because "_" can be used in Ruby to make numbers more readable. 

This means you also need to make sure there is underscore character in the product name field for any products.
