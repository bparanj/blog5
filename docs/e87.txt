Generating RSS feed for articles is a waste of time. Generating a RSS feed for iTunes submission of a podcast is a good idea.

Download feed icons from http://www.feedicons.com/.


In application.html.erb:

<%= yield :head %>



<% content_for :head, auto_discovery_link_tag(:atom, articles_url(format: "atom")) %>

<%= link_to image_tag("feed-icon-28x28.png"), articles_url(format: "atom") %>

index.rss.builder
