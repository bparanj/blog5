Semi Static Pages in Rails 5

Create a new Rails 5 project.

```
rails new static
```

Copy the seeeds.rb to your project. Create the product and page models.

```
rails g model product name price:decimal released_on:date
rails g model page name permalink content:text 
```

Change the generated migration file to define an index for permalink:

```ruby
add_index :pages, :permalink
```

Generate a pages controller.

```
rails g controller pages index show new edit create update destroy
```

Copy the views for pages controller, `_form.html.erb`, edit.html.erb, index.html.erb, new.html.erb and show.html.erb. Generate a info controller with about, privacy and license actions.

rails g controller info about privacy license

The info/about.html.erb has static content. Migrate and populate the database.

rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
